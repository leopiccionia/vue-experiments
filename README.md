# Vue experiments

Some self-contained (one-component) Vue experiments that I designed to practice and/or fight boredom.

* [Clock.vue](src/Clock)
  * A real-time clock using handmade SVG, CSS transformations and custom properties.
* [ConwaysGameOfLife.vue](src/ConwaysGameOfLife)
  * An optimized implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
* [Playlist.vue](src/Playlist)
  * Practicing Flexbox, `backdrop-filter` and UI design.
